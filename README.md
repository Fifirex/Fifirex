Hello there Reader.

```
You could not live with your own projects. 
Look where did that bring you... back to my profile.
```

### Talking about _ME_
I am just another curious Uni student who knows close to nothing and is yet eager to explore it all. 
Have just started with the world of Open Source and I am open to contributing where I can! 

I am low on the project count (if thats a thing ;_;), but you can check them out and contribute if you wish to! (would appreciate that). 

_Lot of cool stuff coming up in the near future (* excited noises *)_

And I love Pizza :D
