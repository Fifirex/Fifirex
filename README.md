Hello! I am a third year undergraduate student from IIT Kharagpur. I like to work on problems that create a meaningful impact. This journey of finding such problems has taken me far and wide in my research endeavours. I have and am working in the fields of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Usable Security and Privacy. My work focuses on creating an impact by working on meaningful applications of these fields while learning more everyday!
